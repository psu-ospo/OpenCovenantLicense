1. PREAMBLE

The Open Covenant License (OCOV) supports open and transparent information sharing towards innovation, education, and societal advancement. Recognizing the power of freely provided content to enrich the global commons, the OCOV aims to establish a covenant of openness balanced with responsibility.

This license facilitates the distribution of profits generated from for-profit activities to creators and maintainers of freely offered content that adds value to the community. It is designed to encourage the sustainable support of open resources, including but not limited to text, audio, video, images, software, and models, by pledging a share of net profits to such content in an equitable manner that acknowledges each creator's contribution.

Furthermore, the OCOV enshrines the principle of transparency in all content creation and distribution stages. It requires adherence to ethical standards, ensuring that while openness is encouraged, respect for the sensitivity of certain types of content is maintained.

The license is particularly mindful of the potential harm information can cause when misused. Therefore, it makes explicit provisions to protect sensitive content for statutory, subjective, or objective reasons. In doing so, the OCOV seeks to harmonize the free flow of information with the imperative to safeguard individual privacy, security, and well-being.

By adopting the Open Covenant License, all parties—creators, distributors, and users—enter into a mutual agreement to uphold these values, fostering a responsible and progressive ecosystem where information is shared and protected with integrity and foresight.

2. DEFINITIONS

These terms are defined for this Open Covenant License (OCOV):

"Net Profits": The remaining profit after all operating expenses, taxes, interest, and dividends have been deducted from total revenue. Net profits are calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

"Value Added": The economic value that is added to goods or services at each stage of its production or distribution. In the context of this license, it pertains to the contribution made by freely-provided content to the profitability or value of the end product or service.

"Freely-Provided Content": Any original work, creation, or intellectual property offered without charge or restriction to access, use, modification, and sharing, subject to the terms of this license.

"Sensitive Content": Information or data that requires protection due to its potential to cause harm if misused. This content falls into three categories as defined by this license: statutory, subjective, and objective.

"Statutory": Pertains to information or data that is protected under law and requires special handling or protection. This includes, but is not limited to, health records, financial information, and biometric identifiers, which are governed by specific legal regulations and ethical standards.

3. SCOPE

This Open Covenant License (OCOV) governs the use, distribution, modification, and contribution to the content it applies to. The following stipulates the scope of the license:

Applicability: The OCOV applies to any content that the creator or rights holder has explicitly licensed under the terms of the OCOV. This license applies to content available in any form, such as written materials, audio recordings, video footage, images, software, and models.

Use of Licensed Content: Users are permitted to access, use, and engage with the licensed content in any lawful manner consistent with the terms provided herein. These applications include educational, research, personal, and commercial uses, as long as such uses do not conflict with the protections for sensitive content as defined in Section 2.

Distribution of Licensed Content: Distributors may share, disseminate, or otherwise make available the licensed content to others, provided they adhere to the terms of the OCOV, including the profit-sharing and transparency obligations.

Modification and Contribution: Users are allowed to modify the licensed content, create derivative works based on it, and contribute back to the original or distribute the modified content, subject to the same terms as the original content.

Profit Sharing Obligation: Any entity that benefits financially from using the licensed content agrees to share a portion of net profits as defined in Section 2. Profit-sharing is a fundamental and required tenet of the OCOV for commercial entities that derive value from the licensed content.

Transparency: Entities that distribute or modify licensed content must provide transparency into their supply chains and profit-sharing mechanisms to ensure that contributions are distributed fairly and in accordance with the value added by the content.

Protection of Sensitive Content: All users and distributors must respect the classifications of sensitive content as statutory, subjective, or objective and must ensure that such content is handled in accordance with legal, ethical, and safety considerations detailed in the OCOV.

Non-Applicability: The OCOV does not apply to content not explicitly licensed under these terms, nor does it override statutory rights such as fair use or fair dealing provisions that may be applicable under the law.
The scope of this license is intended to provide a clear framework for the open distribution and responsible use of content while ensuring creator compensation, sensitive content protection, and transparency maintenance throughout the content's lifecycle.

4: PROFIT SHARING

The Open Covenant License (OCOV) stipulates that entities generating net profits from licensed content shall allocate and distribute a fair share of those profits back to the creators. This section outlines the mechanisms and principles guiding this process:

Profit Sharing Commitment: An entity that derives net profits from the utilization of licensed content agrees to allocate and distribute 10% of those net profits to support the creators of the content. This is a reflection of the value that freely-provided content contributes to the entity's commercial success.

Calculation of Net Profits: Net profits are to be calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) relevant to the jurisdiction of the entity's operation. The calculation should deduct all expenses including, but not limited to, operational costs, taxes, interest, and dividends paid.

Determination of Value Added: The value added by the licensed content shall be determined by a fair and verifiable method that considers the extent to which the content contributed to the generation of net profits. This may involve proportional allocation based on usage metrics, direct revenue attribution, or other equitable methods.

Distribution Mechanism: Profits designated for sharing under the OCOV shall be distributed at regular intervals, at least annually, to the creators. The distribution shall be executed through transparent and auditable channels.

Reporting Requirements: Entities are required to provide a transparent account of their profit-sharing calculations, including the net profits generated, the value added by the licensed content, and the resulting distributions made. This report should be made publicly available to ensure transparency.

Dispute Resolution: In the event of a dispute regarding the calculation or distribution of profits, an independent auditor may be appointed to review the process and ensure compliance with the terms of the OCOV.

Compliance: Entities must demonstrate ongoing compliance with the profit-sharing requirements of the OCOV as a condition of their continued use of the licensed content. Non-compliance may result in the termination of the license and the right to use the content.
This profit-sharing model is designed to ensure that the creators of freely-provided content are recognized and compensated for their contributions to the commercial successes of others, fostering a sustainable ecosystem of open content creation and distribution.

The profit-sharing section is crucial because it outlines the financial responsibilities of those who benefit from the open content. It's designed to ensure that the creators are fairly compensated and that there is a clear, enforceable mechanism for this compensation. It also provides for transparency and accountability, which are fundamental to the philosophy of the Open Covenant License.

5: Transparency Requirements

In the spirit of fostering an open and ethical environment for the creation and distribution of content, the Open Covenant License (OCOV) mandates supply chain transparency for entities benefiting from the use of licensed content. This section sets forth the expectations and standards for such transparency.

Supply Chain Disclosure: Entities must disclose relevant information about their supply chains that pertains to the production, modification, or distribution of the licensed content. This includes the identification of suppliers, production locations, and business practices that are material to the creation and dissemination of the content.

Transparency in Profit Sharing: Entities are required to provide detailed and accessible reports on how the profit-sharing commitment is calculated and fulfilled. This includes clear accounting of net profits, the methodology for determining the value added by the licensed content, and evidence of the distributions made to content creators.

Ethical Sourcing: Entities must ensure that their supply chains adhere to ethical standards, including but not limited to the fair treatment of labor, sustainable practices, and respect for the rights of creators and contributors.

Disclosure Format: The required disclosures shall be made in a format that is readily accessible and understandable to the public. Entities should strive to present this information in a manner that facilitates informed decision-making by consumers and other stakeholders.

Regular Updates: The disclosed supply chain information must be kept current with regular updates, at least annually or more frequently if significant changes occur. This ensures that the transparency commitment reflects the ongoing practices of the entity.

Auditing and Verification: Entities are encouraged to undergo independent auditing and verification of their supply chain disclosures to validate their accuracy and authenticity. This may involve third-party certifications or other credible means of assurance.

Non-Disclosure of Sensitive Information: While transparency is a core value of the OCOV, entities are not required to disclose information that could compromise sensitive content as defined in Section 2, or that could cause harm to individuals or groups as detailed in the license.

Compliance: Continuous adherence to these transparency requirements is essential for the maintenance of the license. Failure to comply with these standards may result in the revocation of the license and the privileges it confers.

This commitment to transparency ensures that entities engage in practices that are congruent with the ethical distribution of knowledge and the equitable remuneration of content creators, reinforcing trust and integrity within the ecosystem fostered by the OCOV.

6: PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE CONTENT

The Open Covenant License (OCOV) recognizes the need to carefully manage sensitive content to prevent harm and uphold ethical standards. The license categorizes sensitive content into statutory, subjective, and objective types, each requiring specific consideration and treatment.

Statutory Protections: Entities using OCOV-licensed content must comply with all applicable laws and regulations governing the protection of sensitive information, such as data privacy laws, health record regulations, and financial data security standards. This includes implementing appropriate security measures and controls to safeguard such information.

Handling Subjective Sensitivities: Recognizing that certain content may be sensitive due to its impact on the feelings, beliefs, or values of individuals or groups, entities must exercise discretion and respect in the use and distribution of such content. This may involve content warnings, the implementation of consent mechanisms, or other measures to ensure that the content is not used in a way that could cause offense or distress.

Mitigating Objective Risks: Content that poses a risk of actual harm, such as threats, violence, or abuse, must be managed with utmost care. Entities must not use or distribute content that could endanger physical or mental well-being. If such content is necessary for educational or informational purposes, entities should provide appropriate context, warnings, and support resources.

Content Review and Oversight: Entities are encouraged to establish review processes and oversight mechanisms to ensure sensitive content is handled according to the principles of the OCOV. This could involve content moderation teams, ethical review boards, or consultation with affected communities.

Transparency in Handling Sensitive Content: While protecting privacy and security, entities should be transparent about their policies and practices for managing sensitive content. This includes publicly available guidelines on how different types of sensitive content are treated and how decisions are made regarding their use and distribution.

Training and Awareness: Entities should provide training to their staff and stakeholders on the importance of protecting sensitive content and the specific requirements of the OCOV in this regard. This ensures that all parties are aware of their responsibilities and the potential consequences of mishandling such content.

Reporting and Redress: The OCOV provides mechanisms for individuals or groups to report concerns or complaints about the handling of sensitive content. Entities must address such reports promptly and take appropriate action to rectify any issues.

Continuous Improvement: Entities are expected to continually assess and improve their practices for managing sensitive content. This may involve staying abreast of evolving legal standards, societal expectations, and technological developments that can enhance the protection of sensitive information.

By adhering to these principles, entities contribute to a responsible ecosystem where the benefits of open content can be enjoyed without compromising individual rights or societal norms.
