1. PREAMBLE

The Open Covenant License (OCOV) supports open and transparent information sharing towards innovation, education, and societal advancement. Recognizing the power of freely provided content to enrich the global commons, the OCOV aims to establish a covenant of openness balanced with responsibility.

This license facilitates the distribution of profits generated from for-profit activities to creators and maintainers of freely offered content that adds value to the community. OCOV encourages the sustainable support of open resources, including, but not limited to, text, images, video, audio, software, and models, by pledging a share of net profits to such content equitably that acknowledges each creator's contribution.

Furthermore, the OCOV enshrines the principle of transparency in all content creation and distribution stages. It requires adherence to ethical standards, ensuring that while openness is encouraged, respect for the sensitivity of certain types of content is maintained.

The license is particularly mindful of the potential harm information can cause when misused. Therefore, it makes explicit provisions to protect sensitive content for statutory, subjective, or objective reasons. In doing so, the OCOV seeks to harmonize the free flow of information with the imperative to safeguard individual privacy, security, and well-being.

By adopting the Open Covenant License, all parties—creators, distributors, and users—enter into a mutual agreement to uphold these values, fostering a responsible and progressive ecosystem where information is shared and protected with integrity and foresight.

2. DEFINITIONS

The Open Covenant License (OCOV) defines these terms:

"Net Profits": The remaining profit after deducting all operating expenses, taxes, interest, and dividends from total revenue. Licensees MUST calculate net profits by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).

"Value Added": The economic value added to goods or services at each stage of its production or distribution. In the context of this license, it pertains to the contribution made by freely-provided content to the profitability or value of the end product or service.

"Freely-Provided Content": Any original work, creation, or intellectual property offered without charge or restriction to access, use, modification, and sharing, subject to the terms of this license.

"Sensitive Content": Information or data that requires protection due to its potential to cause harm if misused. This content falls into three categories this license defines: statutory, subjective, and objective.

"Statutory": Pertains to information or data protected under law and requiring special handling or protection. This category includes but is not limited to, health records, financial information, sealed court records, national defense information, law enforcement information, and biometric identifiers governed by specific legal regulations and ethical standards.

"Subjective": Relates to information or data that affects the feelings, beliefs, or values of a person or group. This type of content is sensitive for some individuals or communities because it relates to their identity, worldview, or morality.

"Objective": Information or data that has the potential to cause actual harm or damage to a person or group. This category includes content that poses a threat to someone's physical or mental well-being, such as threats, violence, offensive weapons, or abuse.

"Supply Chain Transparency": The disclosure of information that allows consumers and other stakeholders to see each step in the supply chain of a product or service. Transparency involves the honest reporting of practices, partners, and business transactions related to producing and distributing goods and services.

"Creator": An individual or entity producing content covered by this license.

"Distributor": Any individual or entity that disseminates content covered by this license, whether for profit or not.

"User": Any individual or entity that engages, consumes, or utilizes the content covered by this license.

3. SCOPE

This Open Covenant License (OCOV) governs the use, distribution, modification, and contribution to the content it applies to. The following stipulates the scope of the license:

Applicability: The OCOV applies to any content that the creator or rights holder has explicitly licensed under the terms of the OCOV. This license applies to content available in any form, such as written materials, audio recordings, video footage, images, software, and models.

Use of Licensed Content: Users MAY access, use, and engage with the licensed content in any lawful manner consistent with the terms provided herein. These applications include educational, research, personal, and commercial uses, as long as such uses do not conflict with the protections for sensitive content defined in Section 2.

Distribution of Licensed Content: Distributors MAY share, disseminate, or otherwise make available the licensed content to others, provided they adhere to the terms of the OCOV, including the profit-sharing and transparency obligations.

Modification and Contribution: Users MAY modify the licensed content, create derivative works based on it, and contribute back to the original or distribute the modified content, subject to the same terms as the original content.

Profit Sharing Obligation: Any entity that benefits financially from using the licensed content agrees to and MUST share a portion of net profits as defined in Section 2. Profit-sharing is a fundamental and required tenet of the OCOV for commercial entities that derive value from the licensed content.

Transparency: Entities that distribute or modify licensed content MUST provide transparency into their supply chains and profit-sharing mechanisms to ensure that contributions are distributed fairly and by the value added by the content.

Protection of Sensitive Content: All users and distributors MUST respect the classifications of sensitive content as statutory, subjective, or objective and ensure content handling by legal, ethical, and safety considerations detailed in the OCOV.

Non-Applicability: The OCOV does not apply to content not explicitly licensed under these terms, nor does it override statutory rights such as fair use or fair dealing provisions that may be applicable under the law.
The scope and intent of this license provide a clear framework for the open distribution and responsible use of content while ensuring creator compensation, sensitive content protection, and transparency maintenance throughout the content's lifecycle.

4: PROFIT SHARING

The Open Covenant License (OCOV) stipulates that entities generating net profits from licensed content MUST allocate and distribute a fair share of those profits back to the creators. This section outlines the mechanisms and principles guiding this process:

Profit Sharing Commitment: An entity that derives net profits from the utilization of licensed content agrees to allocate and distribute 10% of those net profits to support the creators of the content. This commitment reflects the value of freely-provided content to the entity's commercial success.

Calculation of Net Profits: Net profits calculation MUST occur via generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) relevant to the jurisdiction of the entity's operation. The calculation SHOULD deduct all expenses, including, but not limited to, operational costs, taxes, interest, and dividends paid.

Determination of Value Added: Determining the value added by the licensed content MUST occur by a fair and verifiable method that considers the extent to which the content contributed to generating net profits. This determination MAY involve proportional allocation based on usage metrics, direct revenue attribution, or other equitable methods.

Distribution Mechanism: Profits designated for sharing under the OCOV MUST be distributed to the creators at regular intervals, at least annually. Distributors MUST execute profit-sharing transfers through transparent and auditable channels.

Reporting Requirements: Entities MUST provide a transparent account of their profit-sharing calculations, including the net profits generated, the value added by the licensed content, and the resulting distributions made. For-profit activities utilizing OCOV-licensed materials MUST make publicly available reports to ensure transparency.

Dispute Resolution: In the event of a dispute regarding the calculation or distribution of profits, licensees MAY appoint an independent auditor to review the process and ensure compliance with the terms of the OCOV.

Compliance: Entities MUST demonstrate ongoing compliance with the profit-sharing requirements of the OCOV as a condition of their continued use of the licensed content. Non-compliance MAY result in the termination of the license and the right to use the content.

5: Transparency Requirements

To foster an open and ethical environment for creating and distributing content, the Open Covenant License (OCOV) mandates supply chain transparency for entities benefiting from licensed content. This section sets forth the expectations and standards for such transparency.

Supply Chain Disclosure: Entities MUST disclose relevant information about their supply chains concerning the licensed content's production, modification, or distribution. This disclosure includes the identification of suppliers, production locations, and business practices that are material to the creation and dissemination of the content.

Transparency in Profit Sharing: Entities MUST provide detailed and accessible reports on how the profit-sharing commitment is calculated and fulfilled. This reporting includes clear accounting of net profits, the methodology for determining the value added by the licensed content, and evidence of the distributions made to content creators.

Ethical Sourcing: Entities MUST ensure that their supply chains adhere to ethical standards, including but not limited to the fair treatment of labor, sustainable practices, and respect for the rights of creators and contributors.

Disclosure Format: The required disclosures MUST be made in a readily accessible format that is understandable to the public. Entities SHOULD strive to present this information to facilitate informed decision-making by consumers and other stakeholders.

Regular Updates: The disclosed supply chain information MUST be updated regularly, at least annually, or more frequently if significant changes occur. This reporting ensures that the transparency commitment reflects the ongoing practices of the entity.

Auditing and Verification: Entities are encouraged to undergo independent auditing and verification of their supply chain disclosures to validate their accuracy and authenticity. This activity MAY involve third-party certifications or other credible means of assurance.

Non-Disclosure of Sensitive Information: While transparency is a core value of the OCOV, entities are not required to disclose information that could compromise sensitive content as defined in Section 2 or cause harm to individuals or groups as detailed in the license.

Compliance: Continuous adherence to these transparency requirements is essential for maintaining the license. Failure to comply with these standards MAY result in the revocation of the license and the privileges it confers.

This commitment to transparency ensures that entities engage in practices congruent with the ethical distribution of knowledge and the equitable remuneration of content creators, reinforcing trust and integrity within the ecosystem fostered by the OCOV.

6: PROTECTION OF SENSITIVE CONTENT

The Open Covenant License (OCOV) recognizes the need to carefully manage sensitive content to prevent harm and uphold ethical standards. The license categorizes sensitive content into statutory, subjective, and objective types, each requiring specific consideration and treatment.

Statutory Protections: Entities using OCOV-licensed content MUST comply with all applicable statutes, laws, and regulations governing the protection of sensitive information, such as data privacy laws, health record regulations, sensitive government information, and financial data security standards. These protections include implementing appropriate security measures and controls to safeguard such information.

Handling Subjective Sensitivities: Recognizing that certain content MAY be sensitive due to its impact on the feelings, beliefs, or values of individuals or groups, entities MUST exercise discretion and respect in the use and distribution of such content. This discretion MAY involve content warnings, the implementation of consent mechanisms, or other measures to assure content utilization in a manner that a reasonable person would consider as not causing harm.

Mitigating Objective Risks: Content that poses a risk of actual harm, such as threats, violence, or abuse, MUST be managed with utmost care. Entities MUST NOT use or distribute content intended to endanger physical or mental well-being. If such content is necessary for educational or informational purposes, entities SHOULD provide appropriate context, warnings, and support resources.

Content Review and Oversight: Entities are encouraged to and MAY establish review processes and oversight mechanisms to ensure sensitive content handling according to the principles of the OCOV. This review and oversight could involve content moderation teams, ethical review boards, or consultation with affected communities.

Transparency in Handling Sensitive Content: While protecting privacy and security, entities SHOULD be transparent about their policies and practices for managing sensitive content. This transparency includes publicly available guidelines on treatment and decisions regarding different types of sensitive content and their use and distribution.

Training and Awareness: Entities SHOULD train their staff and stakeholders on the importance of protecting sensitive content and the specific requirements of the OCOV in this regard. This education ensures all parties know their responsibilities and the potential consequences of mishandling such content.

Reporting and Redress: The OCOV provides mechanisms for individuals or groups to report concerns or complaints about handling sensitive content. Entities MUST address such reports promptly and take appropriate action to rectify any issues.

Continuous Improvement: Entities are expected to and SHOULD continually assess and improve their practices for managing sensitive content. This MAY involve staying abreast of evolving legal standards, societal expectations, and technological developments that can enhance the protection of sensitive information.

By adhering to these principles, entities contribute to a responsible ecosystem where they can enjoy the benefits of open content without compromising individual rights or societal norms.
